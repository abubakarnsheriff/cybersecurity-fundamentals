## Risk Assessment

Risk assessment evaluates the likelihood and impact of potential security events.

## Risk Formula
Risk = Likelihood × Impact

## Why it matters
Not all vulnerabilities deserve equal attention.

## My Insight
Security fails when teams chase low-risk issues and ignore high-impact ones.
