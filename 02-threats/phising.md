## Phishing

Phishing is a social engineering attack that tricks individuals into revealing sensitive information.

## Common Forms
- Email phishing
- SMS phishing (smishing)
- Voice phishing (vishing)

## Why it matters
Phishing bypasses technical defenses by targeting human psychology.

## My Insight
Phishing succeeds because systems assume users will behave rationally.
