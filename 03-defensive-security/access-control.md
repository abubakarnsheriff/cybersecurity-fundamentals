## Access Control

Access control determines what authenticated users are allowed to do.

## Models
- Role-based access control
- Least privilege
- Attribute-based access control

## Why it matters
Limiting permissions reduces the impact of compromise.

## My Insight
Most breaches escalate because access control was too generous.
