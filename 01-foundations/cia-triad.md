## The CIA Triad

The CIA Triad represents the three core goals of cybersecurity.

### Confidentiality
Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized users.

### Integrity
Ensuring data is accurate and not improperly modified.

### Availability
Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.

## Why it matters
Every security control exists to protect at least one part of the CIA triad.

## My Insight
Most security decisions are trade-offs between availability and confidentiality.
