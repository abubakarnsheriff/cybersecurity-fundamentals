## What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage.

## Why it matters
Modern societies depend on digital infrastructure. Weak security leads to financial loss, privacy violations, and national risk.

## Core Areas
- Network security
- Application security
- Data protection
- Human factors

## My Insight
Most security failures are caused by human behavior and poor design, not advanced attackers.
