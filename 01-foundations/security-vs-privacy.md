## Security vs Privacy

Security and privacy are related but distinct concepts.

## Security
Security focuses on protecting systems and data from unauthorized access, breaches, and damage.

## Privacy
Privacy focuses on how personal data is collected, used, shared, and controlled.

## Why it matters
A system can be secure but still violate privacy through excessive data collection.

## My Insight
Security protects systems; privacy protects people. Confusing the two leads to ethical failures.
