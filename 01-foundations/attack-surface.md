## Attack Surface

The attack surface is the total number of points where an attacker could attempt to enter or extract data from a system.

## Examples
- Open network ports
- User input forms
- APIs
- Weak authentication points

## Why it matters
Larger attack surfaces increase the probability of successful attacks.

## My Insight
Most security improvements come from reducing attack surface, not adding complex defenses.
